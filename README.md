## Graphics & Rendering Techniques


### Lighting
Directional lighting to simulate natural sunlight and dynamic shadows.


### Camera System
Cinemachine is used to provide smooth camera movement and adaptive views based on vehicle speed and direction.


### Textures & Shaders
Optimized textures and reflective shaders are applied to vehicles and environments to enhance realism without affecting performance.


### Animations
Vehicle movement, wheel rotation, and interaction animations are triggered dynamically during gameplay.
